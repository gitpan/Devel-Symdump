Subject: Devel::Symdump-1.21


WHAT'S NEW

->diff method that computes the difference between two snapshots of
the symbol table.

Distribution package renamed to Devel-Symdump instead of only Symdump.

Added a basic README file.

--------

To install unpack it wherever you want, and run the commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install                      # as root

See the test scripts for examples of the usage. The Module contains
its own pod.

I hope you enjoy it,
