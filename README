Devel::Symdump

provides a convenient way to inspect perl's symbol table.

Recent changes:

I'm trying to take advantage of the *entry{SCALAR} style that is much
superior to the old way of getting at the symbol table. 1.22 seems to
break on 5.003 and to work only partly on 5.003_10. So I'm backing out
all the changes except for as_HTML.  Release 1.23 is without
substantial change against 1.21.
